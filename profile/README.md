> :warning: This org and its mirrors are a WIP.

Welcome to DoomELPA, an archive for packages maintained by the [Doom Emacs]
project. This exists (or will exist) to house (and/or mirror) packages that:

- Doom depends on,
- That are abandoned and need some maintenance, even if only temporarily,
- Are embedded in larger repos, so are expensive to download and/or track,
- Have moved off github to less stable or featureful hosts (e.g. ones that 
  don't support shallow cloning, have occasional SSL hiccups, or variable 
  uptime),
- That have software licenses that are incompatible with Doom, and so cannot
  be vendored directly,
- Are included in Emacs but happen to be broken or buggy in a supported release,
  and/or have (or need) fixes that we cannot wait for an Emacs' release cycle 
  for.
- Are on forges that aren't "available" in some countries (later, this org will
  offer alternative downloads built through some CI/CD process -- this may also
  benefit Doom-based CI/CD -- so folks have an alternative to `doom install`).
