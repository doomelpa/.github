> :warning: This org and its mirrors are a WIP.

Welcome to DoomELPA, an archive for mirrors of packages that are installed by
[Doom Emacs]' modules. This exists because:

- Some packages have hefty git histories (often because they're kept in the same
  directory as a larger project),
- Some packages have moved off github to less stable or featureful hosts (e.g.
  ones that don't support shallow cloning or have poor uptime
  \*cough\**savannah*),
- Some packages have software licenses that are incompatible with Doom,
  preventing us from vendoring them in Doom,
- Some packages that live in Emacs core have been broken, and need a fix that
  cannot wait for Emacs' release cycle.
- Github isn't "available" in some countries, so we need the infrastructure to
  deliver all packages in one simple download (also great for CI/CD).
